    "STREGNTH:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ease of Utilize:\n",
    "Prophet is profoundly instinctive and doesn't require profound factual information, which makes it open to a wide run of clients, counting those less experienced in time arrangement investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularity & Drift Discovery:\n",
    "Prophet exceeds expectations in capturing clear regular patterns (every day, week after week, annually) and long-term development designs, particularly in trade estimating. It's outlined for applications like request and deals determining.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lost Information & Exceptions Taking care of:\n",
    "Prophet can naturally handle lost information and exceptions successfully, making it strong for real-world loud datasets. Clients do not ought to clean information broadly some time recently applying the show.\n",
    "Customizable Seasonalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "Prophet permits for the customization of regular components by altering parameters or indicating occasions, which progresses exactness in businesses with patterned patterns (e.g., retail, coordinations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking care of Occasions (Holidays/Special Events):\n",
    "It's especially well-suited for determining around holidays and known occasions that can be effectively indicated within the demonstrate. \n",

    "#WEAKNESSES:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Constrained Non-Linear Modeling:\n",
    "Whereas it performs well for straight patterns and well-defined regularity, Prophet battles with profoundly complex, non-linear connections that will exist in information, particularly in cases like stock advertise forecasts or chaotic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Presumption of Added substance Connections:\n",
    "Prophet essentially accept that the impacts of drift and regularity are added substance. Whereas it can be arranged for multiplicative regularity, this may not continuously fit the reality of certain information designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constrained Adaptability in Highlight Designing:\n",
    "Prophet centers intensely on time-based designs, and whereas it allows a few adaptability, it isn't as versatile to complex multivariate time arrangement as models like LSTM. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prophet is particularly effective in business applications where seasonality and trends dominate, such as sales and demand forecasting. In scenarios with clear seasonality, it often outperforms more complex models, thanks to its simplicity and robust handling of holiday effects.\n"

    "ARIMA (AutoRegressive Coordinates Moving Normal) model is established in well-established measurable hypothesis. this model is exceedingly interpretable and give significant parameters such as auto-regressive terms and moving normal slacks.\n",

    "Great for Direct Connections:\n",
    "ARIMA is especially solid when the fundamental connections within the information are direct. On the off chance that the information appears steady designs over time, ARIMA can capture them viably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency of Stationary Information:\n",
    "ARIMA is great when information can be made stationary (i.e., when there's no slant or regular variety). For shorter-term estimates in money related information or other normally stationary datasets, ARIMA tends to perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customizable:\n",
    "ARIMA permits clients to physically indicate parameters (p, d, q) to make strides the show fit, whereas ETS permits customization for blunder, slant, and regularity components.\n",
    "\n",
    "WEAKNESS\n",
    "\n",
    "Requires Information Stationarity:\n",
    "ARIMA requires the information to be stationary, meaning that the cruel and fluctuation of the time arrangement ought to not alter over time. Information with solid patterns or regularity must be differenced some time recently fitting, which includes complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Battles with Non-Linear Designs:\n",
    "ARIMA models accept direct connections, which limits their appropriateness in datasets with non-linear patterns or complex intelligent between factors.\n",

    "Non-Linear Design Acknowledgment:\n",
    "LSTMs exceed expectations at distinguishing complicated non-linear designs and long-term conditions inside successive information. They can demonstrate more complex connections that conventional factual models may ignore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multivariate Capabilities:\n",
    "LSTMs can handle different highlights (like promoting campaigns, competitor costs, stock levels) at the same time, making them capable in circumstances where a few variables impact the target variable (e.g., request determining).\n",

    "Interpretability:\n",
    "Not at all like less complex models like ARIMA or Prophet, LSTMs work more like a “black box,” which can make it troublesome to decipher how the demonstrate comes to its forecasts. This may be a drawback in commerce scenarios where partners require clear, interpretable bits of knowledge. "
